hyprland-workspace-rename
=========================

I just wanted to assign a static icon to each hyprland workspace, sadly hyprland configuration does not support assign id and name seperately from each other.
Thus this tool was born.

## Usage

Put configuration file `rename_workspace.toml` into the hyprland configuration directory `{XDG_CONFIG_DIR}/hypr`. Start this program at the start of hyprland.

### Configuration Format

``` toml
[workspace_map]
1 = ""
2 = ""
3 = ""
4 = "󱃖"
5 = "󱃖"
6 = "󱃖"
7 = ""
8 = ""
9 = "󰭹"
10 = ""
11 = "󱕴"
```
